# A Skyrim Mod Manager -- for Linux!

Why?

Because I couldn't find a decent Linux-native mod manager for Skyrim, and wanted practice working on a real, useful (at least for me) project.

## Capabilities

-Launch Skyrim from the manager (assumes you are using Steam)

**Planned:**

-Save, apply, and remove modlists
-Automatically download mods from Nexus (will need api key)
