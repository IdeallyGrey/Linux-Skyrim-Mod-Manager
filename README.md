# A Skyrim Mod Manager -- for Linux!

A mod manager for Skyrim, built specifically for Linux (and possibly macOS?) using Bash (and a pretty TUI tool).

*Why?*

Because I couldn't find a fully-featured Linux-native mod manager for Skyrim, and wanted practice working on a real, useful (at least for me) project.

## Capabilities

- Launch Skyrim from the manager (assumes you are using Steam)

**Planned:**

- Save, apply, and remove modlists
- Automatically download mods from Nexus (will need Nexus Premium api key)
- Currently the included version of gum only supports Linux x86_64. Will add ability to have other versions in the future.

## Instructions

## Acknowledgments

This project relies on the tool [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum), allowing for an easy and nice looking TUI.
