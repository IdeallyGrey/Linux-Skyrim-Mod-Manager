# A Skyrim Mod Manager -- for Linux!

A mod manager for Skyrim, built specifically for Linux (and possibly macOS?) using Bash (and a pretty TUI tool).

*Why?*

Because I couldn't find a fully-featured Linux-native mod manager for Skyrim, and wanted practice working on a real, useful (at least for me) project.

## Capabilities

- Launch Skyrim from the manager (assumes you are using Steam)

**Planned:**

- Save, apply, and remove modlists
- Automatically download mods from Nexus (will need api key)

## Instructions

## Acknowledgments

This project relies on the tool [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum), allowing for an easy and nice looking TUI. This script will grab a copy of the binary off of GitHub in case you don't have it installed locally.
